        const text = `In a small coastal town, there was a lighthouse that stood tall on a rocky cliff. It had been guiding ships safely to shore for generations. But as the years went by, rumors began to circulate about strange happenings at the lighthouse.

One stormy night, a group of friends decided to investigate the mysterious occurrences. Armed with curiosity and a sense of adventure, they made their way to the lighthouse. The wind howled and the waves crashed against the rocks, creating an eerie atmosphere.

As they climbed the winding staircase, they noticed flickering lights and heard faint whispers echoing through the tower. The air was heavy with anticipation as they reached the top.

Inside the lantern room, they discovered an old journal, filled with entries from previous lighthouse keepers. The journal spoke of unexplained sightings, ghostly apparitions, and a hidden treasure buried somewhere near the lighthouse.

Intrigued, the friends embarked on a quest to uncover the truth. They followed the clues left behind in the journal, leading them to secret passages and hidden compartments within the lighthouse.

As they delved deeper into the mystery, they encountered strange symbols etched into the walls and encountered unexplained phenomena. Shadows danced along the corridors, and whispers followed them wherever they went.

Finally, they reached the spot where the treasure was said to be hidden. With trembling hands, they unearthed a chest filled with ancient artifacts and precious gems. But as they reached for the treasure, a powerful gust of wind extinguished the lantern, plunging them into darkness.

In that moment, they realized the true nature of the mystery. It wasnâ€™t about the treasure, but about the lighthouse itself. It was a beacon of hope and protection, guarding the town from unseen dangers.

With a renewed sense of purpose, the friends decided to preserve the lighthouseâ€™s legacy. They restored it to its former glory, ensuring that its light would continue to guide ships and protect those at sea.

And so, the lighthouse stood as a symbol of resilience and the enduring power of friendship. The mysteries surrounding it remained, but now they were embraced as part of its rich history.

I hope you enjoyed this mysterious tale ! ðŸŒŸðŸ”¦`;
